# Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition

Ms. Sato is a local trader who is interested in the emerging market of cryptocurrencies. She has started to buy and sell electronic currencies, however at the moment she is tracking all his transaction using a ledger in a spreadsheet which is starting to become burdensome and too disorganized. It is also difficult for Ms Sato to find past transactions or important statistics about the currency. Ms Sato is in need of a digital ledger that helps her track the amount of the cryptocurrency, the transactions, along with useful statistics. 

Apart for this requirements, Ms Sato is open to explore a cryptocurrency selected by the developer.

## Proposed Solution

Design statement:

I will to design and make a digital ledger for a client who is Mr Sato. The digital ledger will be about storing transactions regarding cryptocurrency and is constructed using the software Python It will take until Project Week to make and will be evaluated according to the criterias below.


| Group 1   |              | Group  2  |           |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| Developer | Digital Coin | Developer | Coin      |
| Alex      | Bitcoin      | Alek      | Solana    |
| Bernard   | Ethereum     | Mai       | Dogecoin  |
| Yutaro    | Dogecoin     | Daniela   | BInance   |
| Verlon    | Apecoin      | Kris      | Bitcoin   |
| Oswell    | Tether       | Paula     | Lumens    |
| Thumula   | Tron         | Zaven     | Ethereum  |
| Ainee     | Mana         | Jonathan  | Maker     |
| Lison     | Solana       | Kai       | Avalanche |
| Sabu      | Binance      | Daiichiro | Flow      |
| Emmy      | Polkadot     | Masamu    | Cardano   |
| Maria     | Cardano      | Yasmina   | Zcash     |
| Zelan     | Cosmos       | Jana      | LiteCoin  |
| Manahil   | BinanceUSD   | Lyn       | Iota      |
| Krish     | UsdCoin      | Meisa     | Polkadot  |
|           |              | Mayte     | Cosmos    |
|           |              | Pop       | Ripple    |


Justify the tools of my solution:

I will be using Python for this solution becasue it provides easy data scraping functions and various libraries which could help in providing useful statistic managements to Mr Sato. In addition, python, compared to other older languages, offers programmers the advantage of using fewer lines of code to accomplish tasks, which provides increased simplicity and readability both for programmers and program-readers.

Justify the structure of my solution:

The digital ledger I create is going to be a python project in Pycharm, with a main python file calling different functions pre-written in the library python file and reading, appending, and writing database files. This makes the program more managable as different functions are separately written so the modification of certain files will be more simple. Also, this makes the main python file shorter, which means the structure is going to be more clear and readable.

I will be choosing Bitcoin as my cryptocurrency for this solution:

Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks; managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part. Through many of its unique properties, Bitcoin allows exciting uses that could not be covered by any previous payment system.

## Success Criteria
1. The electronic ledger is a text-based software (Runs in the Terminal).
2. The electronic ledger display the basic description of the cyrptocurrency selected.
3. The electronic ledger allows to enter, withdraw and record transactions.
4. The electronic ledger is protected by a password.
5. The electronic ledger is able to show total amount of inventories.
6. The electronic ledger is able to show the last 10 transactions.
