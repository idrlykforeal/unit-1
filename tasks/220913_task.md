--points that surprised you the most

  1. It is as large as 7000 square feet
  2. It is going to be air blocked
  3. How much supercomputers are committed to military

# Question 2
Supercomputers are currently used to investigate solutions to real life problems from cancer research, Ai, economics, or brain simulation. Military uses are also one major force behind the development of these machines. Analyze the benefits and possible drawbacks of developing supercomputers in our modern world? Should we do it?


Overall, we should have it.

**Advantages:**
- Cost Effective: 
Utilizing supercomputers helps businesses manage jobs more quickly. In the long term, this not only leads to increased efficiency but also decreased costs. Additionally, employing a supercomputer eliminates the need for corporations to invest in pricey physical models.

- **Speed:** 
A supercomputer processes tasks much faster than a standard computer. They typically spend relatively little time performing computations. This pace is approximately 100â€“1000 times lower than that of a typical computer. In other words, a supercomputer may do a work that would normally take many hours in a matter of seconds.

- **Solving complex tasks:** 
A supercomputer may be used to complete challenging jobs with ease, such as producing animations. It generates an excellent outcome overall and renders more quickly.


**Disadvantages:**
- **Maintenance:**
A supercomputer has to be monitored and managed by a knowledgeable team. To do this, specialized software that can identify computer malfunctions and use patterns is employed.

- **High heat release:**
A supercomputer has several processors, all of which have the capacity to produce a substantial quantity of heat while operating. Most electronics are susceptible to damage quickly in this temperatures. A suitable cooling system must thus be implemented in order to prevent this. It's also advised to have the air conditioning installed in the room.

# Question 3
Identify the most advanced computer in your Country.(China)

- **What:** Sunway TaihuLight

- **Location:** Wuxi, in Jiangsu province

- **Specs:** a total of 40,960 Chinese-designed SW26010 manycore 64-bit RISC processors based on the Sunway architecture. Each processor chip contains 256 processing cores, and an additional four auxiliary cores for system management (also RISC cores, just more fully featured) for a total of 10,649,600 CPU cores across the entire system.

- **Uses:** Oil prospecting, life sciences, weather forecast, industrial design, pharmaceutical research

        cs="\033[37m"

    print(f"locker No.{locker_number}, {cs+ color.center(50, '.').upper()+ce}")

```

# Task 2
## Python code

```.py
#task 2: print the color of the inputted locker number

```

# Task 3
## Python code

```.py
