According to a 2010 article in Scientific American, the memory capacity of the human brain was reported to have the equivalent of 2.5 petabytes of memory capacity.  

As a number, a “petabyte” means 1024 terabytes or a million gigabytes, so the average adult human brain has the ability to store the equivalent of 2.5 million gigabytes digital memory.

So the number of USB memories of 4Gb can be calculated by dividing 2.5 million/4, which is 2.5x10^6/4, this is equal to 6.25x10^5

Thus, it needs 625,000 USB memories of 4GB to store an adult human's memory.
